              </p>

              <p>
                I am a versatile type who can bring expertise to every part of
                the design and process of your project, from initial sketches and wireframes to working prototypes, full multi-device screen
                design and delivery of development ready front-end code. These days I work mainly in Figma for UI design. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe the best designers have a good handle on code. I'm a
                proficient front-end developer and have brought many UI designs to life in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS/Sass</strong> and 
                <strong>Javascript</strong>.

                Iâ€™m a big believer in healthy, ego-free collaboration between
                designers, developers, and project owners throughout the
                creative process in order to deliver the best possible products
                to clients and their customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Over the last 15 years I have designed a huge array of projects of all shapes and sizes. I can help you throughout your project process from initial research and planning through to execution and launch, however complex your needs.
